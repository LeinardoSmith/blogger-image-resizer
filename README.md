# Blogger Image Resizer
This is a simple script to include on blogger pages to resize the images of the blog to a specified size.
Blogger does not have a mass image size setting, so I created this little javascript file to do the work.

All that needs changing is the variable at the beginning.
Or if you want include the raw file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeinardoSmith/blogger-image-resizer/master/blogger-image-resizer.js
on your page (the default size it resizes to is 640).

Let me know of any issues you find or any suggestions.
